There was a clause in the oath of the Boule about not imprisoning anyone (Dem. 24.147; see oath ids 1775 and 3492), and it’s a reasonable supposition that the clause also mentioned the penalties of exile and death, which likewise the Boule had no power to inflict.

Cleitagore is presumably a hetaira (and so almost by definition). So too, no doubt, was the other person of whose name we have only the last three letters. It is possible that the first line is a toast to these two ladies, and the second line confirmation thereof.

Bélis identified the passage as coming from Carcinus' Medea, in which, according to Aristotle (Rhetoric 1400b8ff), Medea, exactly as here, is accused of killing her children after they had disappeared, having ""made a mistake in sending them away"".  In the fragment, Jason demands of Medea, who denies killing her children, that she produce them alive.  Medea, who evidently cannot do so, instead makes the sworn statement above; the name of the god(dess) she invoked is lost, but the first few letters of an epithet are uncertainly read as Skuthik- (Scythian).  The next to speak, probably Creon, ignores the oath entirely; Medea, he says, admits to having killed Glauce (Creon's daughter and Jason's new bride), she has surely killed her children too, and he gives Jason permission to put her to death.  It is quite possible that the children have in fact, by this point, already perished at other hands, but if so this is not yet known to any of those on stage.  The fragment is in iambic trimeters, but Medea's lines (and only hers) have musical notation; West argues that the papyrus is not part of a complete text of the play, but an excerpt arranged for ""concert"" performance by a virtuoso singer."

He discusses the issue of Helios being ""All-seeing and All-hearing"" as he is invoked by Agamemnon in this oath. The question is: if the Sun sees and hears everything, why does Odysseus have to tell him that the men have stolen his cattle in the Odyssey. The following solutions are offered: the Sun sees everything but not at the same time; Lampetia who gave the information is his vision; or that it was appropriate for Agamemnon to say as he does, when formulating the oath in the duel episode, “Sun who seest all and hearest all”, and also appropriate for Odysseus to speak as he does to his companions; for the Sun does not, after all, see the things in Hades. This again is a very poor argument, since the event reported to Helios by Lampetia occurred on earth, not in Hades!  A better answer, which appears not to have occurred to Aristotle (or even to Aristarchus, a century and a half later), would have been that from the fact that a messenger reports an event to you, it does not necessarily follow that but for the report you wouldn’t have known about the event; and/or that Lampetia’s report gives Helios an additional cause for complaining to Zeus – namely that his daughter (cf.

But before the appointed day came, Sardis itself was under siege, and Croesus sent a second, urgent request (1.82).  The Spartans took immediate steps to comply, but when they had already finished their preparations news arrived that Sardis had been captured and Croesus taken prisoner (1.83).  In Xenophon, where the story is being told from Cyrus’ point of view, it is not surprising that nothing is said about whether the alliance was actually made or not, since in any case it had no effect on the course of the war.

They subsequently returned to Ceos and overturned the stelai on which the agreement and the names of those who had violated the oath were written. They went on to attack the so-called friends of the Athenians whom the Athenian demos had reinstalled at Iulis, executing some, condemning others to death, and confiscating the property of other including Satyrides, Timoxenus and Miltiades, all in violation of the oath and agreement. These latter three victims were attacked because they had spoken against a certain Antipater when the Athenian boule had condemned him to death for killing Aeson the Athenian proxenos.

This refers to a particular occasion - the revision of the deme registers in 346/5.  The oath of the demesmen is mentioned in Dem. 57.8-9; it was taken at the revision meeting of the deme, and presumably it included an undertaking to decide every case fairly, etc., much as in the dicastic oath.  Euxitheus, the speaker, complains that his enemies deleted from this oath the phrases, which of course formed part of the dicastic oath, about voting ""in accordance with the most just opinion, and not from favour or enmity"" (Dem. 57.63); but he does not say that by doing so they were breaking the law, and it may well be that the oath prescribed by decree for the demesmen on this occasion was shorter and simpler than that prescribed for jurors - in other words, that the phrases mentioned were deleted from the oath, not by Eubulides and his cronies at deme level, but by the Assembly when it set up the review procedure. 
Incidentally, Dem. 57.44 and 53 seem to show that when a man was struck off the deme register and afterwards appealed to a dicastic court, any witnesses he brought forward had to confirm their testimony by oath.  The logic of this, presumably, is that the demesmen's decision was made on oath and should not be overturned on the basis of statements not made on oath."

πλείους εἶναι διανέμωνται τὰ τῶν πλουσίων, τοῦτ’ οὐκ ἄδικόν 
ἐστιν; “ἔδοξε γὰρ νὴ Δία τῷ κυρίῳ δικαίως.”",nh,Zeus,"Aristotle is not making this statement in his own person; the speaking voice here is that of a hypothetical defender of the thesis that the majority have the right to rule; in other words, we have here the familiar use of νὴ Δία to introduce an imaginary objector’s words. The argument (1281a14-21) runs thus, if one puts it, so to speak, into Socratic form: 
 
	Aristotle:  Is it just for the poor, if they are the majority in a city, to seize and redistribute the wealth of the rich? 
	Majoritarian:  Yes (by Zeus), because that was the decision of the rightful rulers, and the decision of the rightful rulers is [apparently by definition] just. 
	Aristotle:  Is justice a virtue? 
	Majoritarian:  Of course. 
	Aristotle:  Can virtue ever ruin its possessor? 
	Majoritarian:  No. 
	Aristotle:  Do you think the city is likely to survive as a cohesive community, if the wealth of the rich is seized in this way? 
	Majoritarian:  Quite likely not. 
	Aristotle:  And will its destruction be the ruin of rich and poor alike? 
	Majoritarian:  I suppose so. 
	Aristotle:  But in that case, according to your own statement, the poor, in causing their own ruin, cannot have been acting justly? 
 
The Statement, taken literally, seems to assume what has to be proved (viz. that the action is just), but this is probably merely due to Aristotle's compressed style.  The chapter proceeds to consider various other possible answers to the question “who has the right to rule?”, and by the end of it we have found that any ruling authority (whether the many, the few, the one, or even the law) may commit unjust acts.  It must follow (though, typically, Aristotle’s text does not spell this out) that the proposition “The decision of the rightful rulers is just” is false; in other words, that no person, group or institution can be said to have the right to rule (to be kyrion, in Aristotle’s terminology) if by that is meant the right to enforce their will, whatever it may be, on the community as a whole."

The terms of the agreement can be summarised as follows:
1. Free access to common sanctuaries
2. The independence of Delphi
3. Peace to last on land and sea for fifty years
4. It was to be unlawful for either the Spartans and their allies or the Athenians and their allies to bear arms against each other (they were to have recourse to courts and oaths if either party violated this rule)
5. Amphipolis was to be restored to Athens
6. In the case of other cities delivered to Athens by the Spartans (Argilus, Stagirus, Acanthus, Stolus, Olynthus and Spartolus) were to be safeguarded if they paid the tribute fixed in the time of Aristeides
7. The Mecybernaeans and Sanaeans and Singians should dwell in their own towns on the same terms as the Olynthians and Acanthians
8. The Spartans were to restore Panactum to the Athenians and the Athenians were to restore Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana, Pteleum and Atalante and any Spartan captives to the Spartans, and any captured Peloponnesians to their homelands
9. The fate of Scione, Torone, Sermyle and any other city held by the Athenians was to be decided by the Athenians as they saw fit.",spond,unknown,"Thucydides states that the Spartans sent Ischagoras, Menas and Philocharidas as envoys to Thrace and ordered Clearidas (their governor) to give up Amphipolis to the Athenians, and the rest of the allies to accept the treaty as it related to each. 
But they were unwilling to do so because they felt that the terms were unfavourable to them, so Clearidas returned to Sparta to see whether the agreement could be changed. When he found that they were bound (by oath) he returned to Amphipolis with orders to return the city if he could or at least remove all the Peloponnesians from the city. 
The envoys of the allies at Sparta would not accept the treaty unless one that was more fair could be made, so the Spartans went ahead and made an alliance with the Athenians on their own.

That does not necessarily entail that the whole work was written that late; this chapter, which ruins the ending of the work, must (if it is by Xenophon) be what one might call a ""grumbling appendix"" rather like chapter 14 of the Lakedaimonion Politeia. Here Xenophon remarks on the decline of morals in Persia after Cyrus' death, giving the example of the satrap Rheomithres who betrays his wife and children and the children of his friends, leaving them as hostages with the king of Egypt. He apparently assisted the satrap Ariobarzanes (who is also mentioned in this passage) in revolting against Artaxerxes II in 367 B.C. Ariobarzanes sent Rheomithres to Tachos, king of Egypt, for help. Rheomithres received troops and money through which he was able to make peace with the king of Persia, and has no concern for the hostages he left in Egypt. Xenophon complains that he has broken 'the greatest oaths', but it is not clear exactly what the oaths were. Perhaps they were the generic oaths sworn by Persians and their king since those of Cyrus and his subjects (see oath ids 2500 and 2501). Betrayal of fellow Persians would certainly count as a violation of this oath.  Alternatively he may be referring to oaths exchanged between Rheomithres and Ariobarzanes themselves as part of their conspiracy.  Xenophon further complains that men capable of such actions seem only to have the highest honours heaped on them."

Apol. 23e, which refers, of course, to the Lycon who was one of Socrates’ accusers.  The present passage, with its praise of Socrates, seems to prove conclusively that the accuser and the father of Autolycus were two different people; the only thing they are known to have in common is that they were apparently both accused in comedy of being foreigners (Eupolis fr. 61, Metagenes fr. 10).

7. The Mecybernaeans and Sanaeans and Singians should dwell in their own towns on the same terms as the Olynthians and Acanthians
8. The Spartans were to restore Panactum to the Athenians and the Athenians were to restore Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana, Pteleum and Atalante and any Spartan captives to the Spartans, and any captured Peloponnesians to their homelands

He is highlighting the severity of swearing a false oath (in this case by Plangon) by quoting the Iliadic phrase which calls the water of the Styx ""the greatest and most awful oath among the blessed gods"". See oath id 3577.  Hera is saying here that it is not by her will that Poseidon is harming the Trojans and helping the Achaeans; rather, she supposes [!] he must have taken it into his own head to do so.  In fact, Poseidon would not have taken any action had he not been told by Sleep that it was safe to do so (14.354-360); and though Sleep was not acting on Hera's explicit orders, he knew very well that this, or something like it, was what Hera wanted – she was not going to all the trouble of putting Zeus to sleep, and making (and swearing to- see oath id 350) an extravagant promise to a minor god, just for fun – so that what Poseidon did was the predictable, intended and desired result of what Hera did and said.

The italicized statement is (we are to understand) false, but because it has been made, not as part of a witness statement, but in the process of refusing to make a witness statement (en apophasei), Callicles is not liable to be sued for giving false testimony since he has not given any testimony at all!!  Of course he had no business making a statement like that to the jury if he wasn’t actually a witness; but he couldn’t help it slipping out … .  In Athens, at the time when Anaximenes was writing, X would have had to prepare a written statement of evidence for Callicles to confirm, and if Callicles refused to confirm it, he would have had to swear that he did not know the statement to be true; but there would of course be no difficulty in composing a statement about which the (non-)witness could truthfully take such an oath.  To take a concrete (if slightly different – and purely imaginary) example: 
 
X falsely accuses Y of beating his wife. 
X prepares a witness statement for Z:  “Y beats his wife regularly.” 
Z, called to the stand, says “No, I can’t testify to that; actually Y has stopped beating her.” 
Z swears that he does not know the prepared statement to be true. 
 
X has thus got Z to tell the jury, falsely, that Y has in the past beaten his wife (and is thus guilty as charged) without either committing perjury or giving false testimony."

This passage is an interesting example of a paradox at the heart of the 'imaginary objector' oath and other rhetorical usages of a similar kind.  Demosthenes' actual point is that walls, trenches, etc., are not all that important; the real protection of a democratic state is something quite different, namely mistrust (especially of tyrants).  In other words, the oath actually devalues the statement to which it is attached.  This is not, I think, because oaths were coming to have little value.  Rather, the ploy is to affirm the truth of a statement, and by that very affirmation to cast doubt on its importance, as English does with ""To be sure"" and ""It is true that"" and German with zwar."

Perhaps the present statement is not offered as an interpretation of the omen; rather, this is a separate prophecy, and the omen is merely referred to as being consistent with it (n.b. oi(=on).  It is also worth noting that when Th. interpreted the omen in book 15, he was reacting to Telemachus’ pessimistic apprehensions about Eurymachus soon being Penelope’s husband and Odysseus’ successor unless Zeus were to “bring about an evil day for him before his marriage” (15.520-4); so that his interpretation implied, even if it did not state, that Zeus would do just that."

As Sommerstein notes ad 203, the Cup of Amity was ""a cup by the sharing of which two or more persons pledge friendship to one another"". The ""if kept"" and ""if broken"" terms and conditions of the oath reflect the characteristic stereotype of women liking their wine neat (see further Sommerstein ad 197). It is noteworthy that the cup of wine used in the oath ritual is brought on by a Scythian; cf. Herodotus 4.70 (id 1327) for details of Scythian oath rituals.

Apollodorus demands that Antiphanes gets up and swears whether he loaned Timotheus 1000 drachmas in Calaureia, and whether Philip received that sum from Pasion. 
Apollodorus presumably wants Antiphanes to do what he wouldn’t do before the arbitrator – either confirm that the money was indeed lent to Timotheus and that it originally belonged to Pasion, or deny it under oath.  (There would surely be no need for an oath – certainly Apollodorus would have no interest in demanding one – if Antiphanes was willing to confirm these propositions.)  And since at the end of §20 Apollodorus passes straight on to other matters, and never mentions Ant. again except briefly in passing at §48, we may safely take it that all this rigmarole about calling Antiphanes as a witness and demanding that he go up to the stand is just play-acting and that Apollodorus knows perfectly well that Antiphanes is not in court at all."

For this reason he asks Hyllus to swear by Zeus before divulging what it is he wants his son to swear to. Actually, Heracles asks Hyllus to swear by Zeus' head (1185) but Hyllus simply invokes Zeus as witness (1188). In so doing, Heracles acts more like a god than a mortal, since elswhere in Greek poetry only deities invoke the head of Zeus as oath object; cf.  oath ids 409, 1334, 1358, 1363.

Simonides has asked, literally, ""How can it not be the case that a tyrant, who can confer such great benefits and gifts on his subjects, will be more loved than an ordinary man can be?""  And Hiero replies ""Because, by Zeus, we also have to do many more of the things that cause a man to be hated.""  Hence the statement is ""That a tyrant, despite the benefits and gifts he can confer on his subjects, will not be greatly loved, because he will also be forced to do many things that make him hated."""

Demosthenes.’s argument based on this clause is a good one:  the jurors are entitled, and even bound, to reject a law if they consider it unjust.  Not so good is the argument based on the ""vote according to the laws"" clause:  if, as in this case, new law N is designed, in whole or in part, to repeal old law V, one cannot say that the jurors are bound by their oath to uphold V and therefore to reject N - unless, of course, one is arguing that no existing law should ever be changed, and that is certainly not something that Demosthenes believed.

Clearchus responded (because the Greeks had no provisions), ""Report to him that we must have a battle first; for we have not had breakfast, and no one should dare speak to the Greeks about a truce unless he provides them with a breakfast"". 
The heralds left, and returned quickly with a report that the King thought what they said seemed reasonable, and that they had brought guides with them who could lead the Greeks to a place where they could get provisions if a truce should be concluded. 
Clearchus asked whether he was making a truce merely with the men who were coming and going, or whether the truce would bind others as well. 
The heralds replied, ""every one of them until your message is carried to the King"". 
Clearchus then took counsel, and it was thought best to conclude a truce quickly so that they could get provisions without being molested. 
Clearchus, however, delayed telling the heralds in order to make them afraid, but then concluded the truce after it seemed the proper time had come. 
After the truce was concluded the heralds led the Greeks to where they could get provisions.

 μὴ λαβεῖν δῶρα μηδὲ λήψεσθαι","omos, ork, wrk",The gods of oaths,"Aeschines claims that Timarchus once asserted that Philotades of Cydathenaeum - a citizen - was a former slave of his, and persuaded the demesmen to disfranchise him. Aeschines claims that Timarchus took charge of the prosecution in court, and after taking the sacrificial victims in his hand, swore by the gods of oaths that he had not taken a bribe and would not, calling down destruction on himself. 
Aeschines claims that it was later proved that Timarchus received 20 minas from Leuconides, Philotades' brother-in-law, money which he soon spent on Philoxene the courtesan. Aeschines states that Timarchus thus abandoned the case and broke his oath. 
The ""gods of oaths"" (horkioi theoi) are Zeus, Apollo and Demeter. 
Fisher ad loc. assumes that the oath was taken at the deme meeting (in Cydathenaeum, a city deme) at which Philotades was struck off; but to judge by Dem. 57, these meetings were attended, and the oaths sworn, only by members of the deme, and Timarchus did not belong to the deme of Cydathenaeum but to that of Sphettus (cf. Aeschines 1.104 – his paternal uncle).  As can be seen from Dem. 57, however, court witnesses were also, exceptionally, required to give their testimony on oath in appeals against deme decisions during this review of the citizen registers (see oath ids 3699, 3701-7, 3709-11).  It is not clear from Dem. 57 alone whether these oaths were taken at the trial itself or at a preliminary hearing.  Now Timarchus evidently did not testify at the trial, with the result that the case against Philotades collapsed.  It must follow, I think, that the witnesses' oaths in such cases were taken at a preliminary hearing, and that Timarchus duly swore one and submitted a deposition but then did not turn up at the trial to confirm it."

When he took a second wife she mistreated Phronime, accused her of lewdness and convinced her husband that the charge was true. 
Etearchus then made friends with a Theran trader named Themison and made him swear an oath to render whatever services he asked. 
When Etearchus ordered Themison to take away Phronime and throw her into the sea Themison was ""angry at being tricked in his oath"" and renounced his friendship with Etearchus. 
He then took the girl away to sea, and in order to quit himself of his oaths to Etearchus, bound the girl with ropes, lowered her into the sea and then pulled her out again. Themison then sailed back to Thera with the girl. 
The date of these events can be extrapolated from the fact that Phronime was the mother of Battus, who founded the Theran colony at Cyrene ca.635."

The sanctuary at Eleusis was to be common to both communities, under the care of the Heralds and Eumolpidae in accordance with tradition.

Those at Eleusis were to contribute to the alliance from their revenues in the same way as the rest of the Athenians [see oath id 1786]. If anyone who emigrated took a house at Eleusis, he was to seek agreement with the owner; if they were unable to agree, each should choose three assessors, and the owner should accept whatever price they fixed. Any of the people of Eleusis might join the community if they were approved by the new settlers. Those who wished to emigrate to Eleusis should be entitled to register, in the case of those already in the city of Athens, within ten days of swearing the oaths of reconciliation, and to emigrate within twenty days; in the case of those who were away from Athens, within the same period from their return. No one living at Eleusis should be entitled to hold office in the city, without cancelling his registration and returning to live in the city. Trials for homicide should be held in accordance with tradition in cases where a man had himself performed the act of killing or wounding. Otherwise no one was to recall the past misdeeds of the anyone except the Thirty, the Ten, the Eleven and the governors of the Piraeus, and not even of these if they successfully submitted to an examination. The examination was to take place, for the governors of the Piraeus, among the men of the Piraeus; for those who had held office in the city, among those possessed of a property qualification.

This is because it alludes to the dispute between Athens and Philip II over Halonnesos (cf. [Dem.] 7).  Athens demanded that Philip “return” the island to her; Philip refused to do so (claiming he had not taken the island from Athens but from a band of pirates), but was willing to “give” the island to Athens (ex gratia, as it were).  On the advice of Hegesippus and Demosthenes, the Assembly refused this offer, and Philip kept the island.  The fragment is itself corrupt:  as transmitted, it won’t scan, so we don’t know what it is that is to be given/returned, but it certainly isn’t wrestling-schools; it must, in fact, be something that one can carry in one’s hand (see end of fragment)."

He says that he does not think they will take the exomosia, but says that if they do he will have the clerk read a proklesis (challenge) by which the jurors will catch the witnesses in their perjury. 
The clerk reads the statement which Stephanus has drafted for these witnesses, and Apollodorus tells the witnesses to give evidence or take the exomosia, which they do. 
Apollodorus then tells the jurors that it was plain they would take the exomosia eagerly, and repeats his claim that he has a proklesis to be read so that they may be convicted of perjury. He then has his proklesis read - that they were present when Apollodorus challenged Stephanus to give up his slave to be put to torture concerning the theft of the document and that Stephanus refused. 
It seems that there must be two sets of witnesses here.  The first set of witnesses are Phormio’s friends, who refuse to testify that they were aware that Stephanus stole the deposition.  The second set are friends of Apollodorus, who bear witness to the fact that he (subsequently) made a challenge in the terms stated.  Apollodorus certainly would not be such a fool as to issue a challenge without having friendly witnesses present.  I note that in the challenge it is stated that ""Apollodorus was ready to write a document specifying the terms upon which the torture was to take place"":  no wonder that Stephanus refused the challenge, if its terms and conditions were to be unilaterally determined by his opponent!  It is perhaps, too, worth mentioning what according to the witnesses were the words of Stephanus' reply to the challenge:  ""If you say I’ve done you any wrong, then sue me if you want to."""

The key clause is ""in the event of the Phocians abandoning it"".

In event (i) it would certainly be Thebes, not Athens, that would earn the prestige.  If Xenophon is thinking clearly (which may be doubted), he must be thinking in terms of event (ii), and suggesting that Athens propose the foundation of a new Hellenic League (perhaps a strengthened version of the Amphictyonic League) with its members bound by a clear treaty commitment to keep the peace with each other and to use force against any future violator of Delphi (or, presumably, against anyone who attacked a member of the League)."

It was only when Aristocrates tried to betray the Messenians to the Spartans for a second time that his original treachery was discovered. Pausanias (4.12) tells us that when this was revealed, the Arcadians themselves stoned Aristocrates to death and threw him out of their borders without burial. They had encouraged the Messenians to join in, but Aristomenes had reacted to the news with eyes fixed to the ground and weeping. So the Arcadians punished Aristocrates themselves. Pausanias says that it was they who set up a tablet in the precinct of Zeus Lycaeus which read: ""Truly time has found justice for an unjust king and, with the help of Zeus, has easily found the betrayer of Messene. It is a difficult thing for a perjured man to escape the notice of god. Hail, king Zeus, and keep Arcadia safe"". Polybius (4.33.3), however, who credits Callisthenes with reporting this inscription, says that the Messenians set it up on a pillar beside the altar of Zeus Lycaeus."

Thucydides adds that the Argives did so on the advice of Alcibiades. Both parties hoped to bring Epidaurus into the ""Argive alliance"" in order to keep Corinth quiet, and to reduce the time it would take to bring aid to Argos from Athens by sea.  
The clause in the treaty between Sparta and Argos stipulated that the Argives ""if they wished, might tender an oath to the Epidaurians, or, if not, should swear one themselves"".  This appears to mean that the dispute over the offering should be settled by the procedure of oath-challenge, with the Argives having the right to choose whether to demand an oath from the Epidaurians (presumably to the effect that they did not owe anything to the sanctuary) or to swear one themselves (presumably to the contrary effect); the side refusing to swear would be deemed to have accepted that it was in the wrong.

This passage clearly refers specifically to Demosthenes' speech supporting the alliance with Callias. This was the occasion when D. allegedly gave the date of a future event he knew would never happen, saying that, as a result of his recent diplomatic activity, large Peloponnesian and Acarnanian forces would be ready to serve under Athenian leadership against Philip by the 16th of Anthesterion 341/0 (Aeschines 3.97-98).

In fact forces from some states in these areas (Corinth and Achaea - also Leucas and Corcyra from the north-west) did serve on the Athenian side in the ensuing war.  Aeschines may well be trying to give the impression that the claims Demosthenes made, and particularly those which he backed by oath, were more comprehensive than they actually were.

 ἀντόμνυμι can be used of any oath sworn by a litigant, though strictly speaking διόμνυμι should be used in homicide cases. 
It is, to say the least, not certain that the half-brothers are ""mature"", since the speaker himself is very young indeed (probably only 18).  The way in which the phrase εὖ εἰδέναι is introduced strongly suggests (and §29 of this speech pretty much conclusively proves) that the oath formula for this type of case ran ""I know well that X has (not) killed"". 
It would not, though, be a breach of such an oath to refuse a torture challenge, even on the assumption (always made by challengers in such cases!) that torture was guaranteed to reveal the truth.

The fact adduced in this story that ""there was no earth"" when birds first existed clearly seems to suit P.'s purpose and there may have been such a story available to Aristophanes (see Sommestein's addendum on 471 in his edition of Wealth p. 293).  Later on, in the parabasis, the birds themselves will give us a revised Theogony (or Ornithogony, as various critics have called it) in which they are indeed older than Earth:  the primal beings are Chaos, Night, Erebus, Tartarus, and Night's son Eros, which between them engender the birds, after which Eros ""mingles all things together"" and brings into being Heaven, Ocean, Earth and the gods.  Thus, as Sommerstein notes, the birds, unlike the gods, were ""begotten ... before all worlds"".  It is crucial (as it often is) that these controversial claims are not denied or challenged by the adversaries of those who advance them.  In the peace negotiations, Peisetaerus demands (1600-1) that Zeus should give the sceptre back again (palin ... apodounai) to the birds; not only do the divine ambassadors not challenge the presupposition of this demand (that rulership belongs to the birds by right), but one of them, Heracles, in agreeing to it, uses exactly the same language (1626).

Presumably the speaker (whether it’s the poetic I, or someone else) is really saying that they’ve got a reliable lock on their tongue, since a lock is what a treasure-house needs if it’s to be a trustworthy place to put treasure. A. H. Sommerstein, in correspondence, suggests that the fragment must be tragic for the following reasons: "" it's dactylo-epitrite - which probably means it's Bacchylides, Pindar, or tragedy - and since SKHPTOUXON is an Ionic-Attic form, not choral Doric, tragedy is more likely (cf. Eur. IT 235).  Another reason for suspecting it's tragedy, if any were needed, is that it's hard to imagine Pindar or Bacchylides proclaiming that they can be trusted to keep their mouths shut. This is surely a chorus, probably of women and probably Euripidean, swearing itself to secrecy in the way so many tragic choruses (mostly of women and mostly Euripidean) do; their choice of Hera to swear by may indicate that they are married, or that they are Argive, or (quite likely) both.

To be sure, Aeschines is putting himself in danger of divine retribution by denying a proposition that he once called the gods to witness; but the jurors aren’t bound by what he may have said or done eight years ago.

 ὥστ’ ὤμοσαν ἦ μὴν ἀκολουθήσειν μετ’ ἐκείνων  ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς τοὺς διασώσαντας τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν·","summac, wmos",unknown,"The Plataean speaker states that even though the Athenians saved the Thebans in the Corinthian War, as soon as the war was over the Thebans abandoned them and made an alliance with the Spartans. 
He contrasts the behaviour of the Thebans with that of the citizens of Chios, Mytilene and Byzantium, arguing that whereas they remained loyal, the Thebans did not even have the courage to remain neutral, but rather showed such cowardice and baseness that they swore to join the Spartans in attacking the Athenians, the saviour of their city. 
This is not as clear as the speaker implies. What he actually means is that ""after"" the seizure of the Cadmeia, the pro-Spartan (if you like, puppet) regime did so.  Isocrates' Plataeans are playing the classic (and not yet obsolete) rhetorical tricks of (a) putting events in the wrong order and/or (b) using the term ""the Thebans"" to refer now to one faction, now to the other, as convenient (the Thebans who were forced to flee to Athens were not the same as - indeed were the enemies of - the Thebans who made the alliance with Sparta; on the other hand each side claimed to be the sole legitimate representatives of ""the Thebans"").

The oaths are broken by the Trojans when Pandarus, under the influence of Athena, shoots an arrow at Menelaus, thus causing the conflict to resume. Aristotle says that the poet does not say that they perjured themselves … but that they were accursed, having cursed themselves by saying [Il. 3.298-300].  That is, they did not commit perjury, but committed the crime of damaging (ἔβλαψα&nu) their oaths [cf. the phrase in 3.299 ὑπέρ ὅρκια πημήνεια&nu] and thus brought a curse on themselves.  Hence Hera tries to ensure that harm comes to them from their own curse; for after they have prayed [3.298-300] Hera makes this suggestion to Athena (see oath id 322).  And damaging is not the same thing as perjuring oneself. It is, of course, a total quibble; if 3.298-300 is indeed an oath, and the Trojans have acted contrary to it, then they have committed perjury, and there’s an end of it.

Prothous addressed the assembly, saying that it seemed to him that they ought to disband the army in accordance with their oaths, and then send round word to the cities to make contributions to a war fund. Then, if anyone tried to prevent the cities from being autonomous, they should call together all who wished to support the cause of independence and lead them against those who opposed it. 
Prothous argued that this would ensure that the gods would be most favourably inclined towards them, and the cities least annoyed. 
The Spartan assembly, however, decided that he was talking nonsense, and sent orders to Cleombrotus not to disband his army, but to lead it against the Thebans if they did not leave the cities autonomous.

That they would not make an attack on the other or their allies],"eirhn, spond",unknown,"This oath is an example of Andocides' customary historical inaccuracy. 
Andocides states that when the Athenians were involved in the war in Euboea (446) and were holding Megara, Pegae and Troezen (Megara revolted in 446), the Athenians longed for peace and recalled Miltiades, the son of Cimon, who had been ostracised, and sent him to Sparta to negotiate a truce. As a result a fifty year peace treaty was concluded, and the Athenians abided by the truce for thirteen years. 
This, however, was not the case. It was Cimon the son of Miltiades who was ostracised (461) and negotiated a truce with the Spartans (451/0).  
This truce actually lasted for five years.  
The Andocides manuscripts read that the truce was for ""five"" years, but editors emend the text of Andocides to match that of Aeschines 2.172 (see oath id 2631) which also states that Miltiades negotiated a truce with the Spartans which lasted for fifty years. 
What was negotiated in 451/0 was a truce for five years.  But obviously Andocides must have written ""fifty"", since he says the truce held for 13 years.  The confusion is truly massive; in fact thirteen years was the duration of the war that was ended by the Thirty Years’ Peace referred to in section 6 of the speech!  In other words:  a five years’ truce that suspended (but did not end) a war whose total duration was thirteen years has become a fifty years’ truce, ending a war of unspecified duration, which held for thirteen years and was followed by a renewed war of unspecified duration. Another possible explanation is that Andocides, without knowing it, is reporting the peace treaty of 446 (see oath id 2384) twice over, and that the thirteen years are meant to run from that date until 433 when Athens incurred the hostility of Corinth by intervening in its conflict with Corcyra. 
Andocides states that the Athenians gained the following benefits from the supposed fifty years' peace: 
1. they fortified the Piraeus [actually done much earlier]; 
2. they built the northern Long Wall [actually done in 457, during a period of active warfare!]; 
3. they built one hundred triremes to replace the old ones that had defeated Xerxes [as if no new ships had been built since 480]; 
4. they established a force of three hundred horsemen; 
5. they purchased the three hundred Scythian archers.

The alliance is said to have included a special clause stipulating that neither party could negotiate a separate alliance with Athens.

When the Chalcidians opened negotiations with Athens, they violated the terms of this agreement and their oaths. Hammond, Philip of Macedon, pp77-8,  argues that Philip used the violation of this oath as the pretext for the destruction of Olynthus. He writes, ""In 348 Philip and his Macedonians felt that they were justified in the sight of Apollo and of Zeus, Earth, Sun and Poseidon in destroying Olynthus for its act of perjury"".

This strongly implies, though it does not explicitly state, that one should never accept a demand for an oath for any other reason, nor volunteer an oath for any reason at all.  Isocrates' own practice may well have conformed with his injunction.  In his surviving works he never once swears in his own name, even informally, or makes any reference to any oath he has taken previously; nor, we learn, did he ever initiate a lawsuit (cf. [Plutarch], Lives of the Ten Orators 839c), which would of course have required him to swear an antomosia.  Twice he was sued himself (with only money at issue - they were antidosis suits about liturgies), but on one of these occasions he was ill and his son acted for him (and presumably swore any necessary oaths) while on the other occasion he lost the case and may for all we know have let it go by default."

Prexaspes betrayed the Magi when they asked him to summon the Persians to a meeting before the palace wall and declare that the king was none other than Smerdis the son of Cyrus. Prexaspes climbed a tower and announced to the Persians that he had murdered Smerdis on the orders of Cambyses, but that he had not told the truth earlier because he could not safely tell it. After doing so he invoked a terrible curse on the Persians if they failed to win back their freedom and hurled himself headlong from the tower.

At 104, he claims that after they had given these pledges to the allies of Athens and the King, and had conquered Athens in war, they reduced those who they had sworn to set free to a state of slavery worse than that of Helots, and they returned the favour to the King by persuading his brother Cyrus to dispute his throne and sent an army to support Cyrus in his endeavour.  (This is massively misleading:  Cyrus needed no Spartan persuasion to dispute his brother's throne; his brother wsa not the King [Darius II] with whom Sparta had made the alliance, but his successor [Artaxerxes II]; and the Greek army that supported him was neither despatched nor financed by Sparta.)

However, the understanding was that if any oligarch should be caught trying to escape the truce should be regarded as broken by all. 
The leaders of the Corcyraean demos feared that the oligarchs would not be put to death, and sent men to tell them that they ought to escape because the Athenian generals were intending to hand them over to the Corcyraean demos.

You were present, surely, with the rest of these officers at the time when the King, after the death of Cyrus and in his elation over that event, sent and ordered us to give up our arms. But when, instead of giving them up, we equipped ourselves with them, and went and encamped beside him, what means did he leave untried - sending ambassadors, begging for a truce, offering us provisions - until in the end he obtained a truce? When, however, our generals and captains, following precisely the plan that you are now urging, went unarmed to a conference with them, relying upon the truce, what happened in that case? Are they not at this moment being beaten, tortured, insulted, unable even to die, hapless men that they are, even though they earnestly long, I imagine, for death?

The verdict will be confused. But, Aristotle argues, the juror who believes the man owes some money but not twenty mnai is NOT in fact committing perjury if he acquits the man, since he is not giving a judgement that the defendant owes nothing, simply that he does not owe twenty mnai. It is only a juror who gives a verdict condemning the defendant when he does not think he owes twenty mnai who is committing perjury."

The role played by Hieramenes and the sons of Pharnaces who are named in the agreement is unclear. Gomme, Andrewes and Dover, A Historical Commentary on Thucydides, Volume V, p139, argue that Krumbholz was correct to see Hieramenes (also mention in Xen. Hell. 2.1.9) and ""the sons of Pharnaces"" as witnesses to the treaty rather than the highest Persian officers in the area. This seems plausible since it is unlikely that the term ""the sons of Pharnaces"" is intended to include Pharnabazus who was a satrap in his own right.

During the Sacred War the Phocians had made it impossible for the regular meetings of the Amphictyonic Council to be held at Thermopylae, and that the Thessalians made their alliance with Philip partly in order to get these meetings restarted.

Leotychides then warned them about the fate of a certain Spartan, Glaucus son of Epicydes, who lived three generations earlier. 
Glaucus had a reputation for justice such that a man from Miletus came to give him half his property (recently converted into silver) for safe-keeping. If Glaucus received the money he would take and keep tokens, and restore the money to any person who came with like tokens and demanded the money back.  
Glaucus received the trust, and after a long time the sons of the Milesian came to Sparta, showed Glaucus the tokens, and demanded the money back. Glaucus claimed that he could not yet remember the matter, and promised that if they returned in four months he would settle the matter one way or another. 
Glaucus then travelled to Delphi to consult the oracle and asked whether he should steal the money ""by an oath"" (ὅρκῳ). 
The priestess threatened him with the following verses: 
""For now, Glaucus son of Epicydes, you have an immediate profit; to win by oath (ὅρκῳ νικῆσαι) and to steal the money; swear (ὄμνυ), since death awaits even the man who swears well (εὔορκον μένει ἄνδρα); but Horkos has a child with no name, nor hands, nor feet, but swift in pursuit, until he has in his grasp all a man's offspring and household, which he destroys. But the offspring of the man who swears well shall afterwards be better"". 
When Glaucus heard this, he asked the god to forgive him for what he had suggested. But the Pythia responded that to tempt the god and to do the deed were the same thing. 
Glaucus then sent for the Milesians and returned the money to them. 
Leotychides then goes on to warn the Athenians that there are no descendants of Glaucus, nor any household that bears his name at Sparta, and warns them that the only good thing to do concerning a trust is to restore it on demand."

Calder (Philologus 118, 1974, 205ff) prefers to see the statement as a generalization, used by Hippodameia to persuade Myrtilus, with particular reference to a sworn promise which had been made by Pelops to her:  she's saying, in effect, ""Pelops has taken an oath, so you can trust him"".

Dicaeogenes II died in a sea-battle off Cnidus, probably that of Syme in early 411 (Thuc. 8.42), and the division of the inheritance remained in effect for twelve years, i.e. from 412/1 until 401/0.

The procedure, as carefully described, is: 
(a) The katalogeis draw up the provisional list of cavalrymen. 
(b) They pass it to the hipparchs and phylarchs who … 
(c)… bring it before the council, who open the sealed document. 
(d) The council erase the names of those who swear that they are not physically fit to serve. 
(e) Those remaining on the list are then summoned before the council. 
(f) Anyone who then swears that he is physically or financially unable to serve is exempted. 
(g) For each man still regarded as liable, the council vote on whether he is a suitable person to serve on horseback. 
It thus looks as though a claim of physical unfitness, once entered, remained on the record, and anyone who had made such a claim in one year would automatically be exempted in future years, without having to appear before the council.  Claims of financial incapacity, on the other hand, had to be publicly renewed each year:  a man’s material fortunes could recover, whereas his physical fitness was less likely to improve with the years (especially when it came to cavalry service, which was very much a young man’s game)."

The Athenian explains that if a suppliant is cheated out of an agreement, after having invoked a god as a witness, that god becomes his guardian and avenger. The man will never be wronged without vengeance being taken for his wrongs. The suppliant is assumed to have invoked a god as a witness to an agreement (homologia). That is, the person supplicated has sworn to protect the suppliant, and the suppliant has accepted this guarantee and has risen from his suppliant posture, thereby passing from the protection of Zeus Hikesios into that of the god(s) named in the oath.  A neat example of such a sequence is that between Medea and Aegeus in Eur. Med. 709ff:  Medea makes herself a suppliant (709-713); Aegeus promises to protect her, and backs up this promise with an oath dictated by Medea (719-755- see oath id 120); Medea releases him from her suppliant’s hold (756).

Thucydides states at 5.53 that the Epidaurians were obliged to send a sacrifice to the Argive-controlled sanctuary of Apollo Pythaeus as payment for pasturage. The Argives accused the Epidaurians of not doing so, and war broke out.  
Thucydides adds that the Argives did so on the advice of Alcibiades. Both parties hoped to bring Epidaurus into the ""Argive alliance"" in order to keep Corinth quiet, and to reduce the time it would take to bring aid to Argos from Athens by sea.  
The clause in the treaty between Sparta and Argos stipulated that the Argives ""if they wished, might tender an oath to the Epidaurians, or, if not, should swear one themselves"".  This appears to mean that the dispute over the offering should be settled by the procedure of oath-challenge, with the Argives having the right to choose whether to demand an oath from the Epidaurians (presumably to the effect that they did not owe anything to the sanctuary) or to swear one themselves (presumably to the contrary effect); the side refusing to swear would be deemed to have accepted that it was in the wrong.

Mantitheus states that his father agreed to the plan, because he believed that if Plangon declined to swear that Boeotus and Pamphilus were his sons, they would no longer be able to cause him problems. 
What is this ""greatest and most formidable"" oath - in the human world, of course, not the divine?  We are given no details in either of the speeches (here and in 39.3).

Should this man be found guilty, he is liable to pay the double value of the item originally sought. The law that one could search another’s house for stolen goods, but only if one first removed one’s outer garment, also existed at Athens, cf. Ar. Clouds 498-9.

This cannot be a reference to the Peace of Philocrates. Cawkwell, CQ 13, (1963), pp133-4, argues that Demosthenes is referring to an amendment to the Peace of Philocrates proposed in 344/3, which would have guaranteed freedom and autonomy to all Greek states.

Thucydides indicates that each city will swear the oath that is most binding in their land. The Athenians were to swear on behalf of their allies, whereas the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies were to swear individually by state. 
It is stipulated that for the renewal of the oath the Athenians will travel to Elis, Mantinea, and Argos, thirty days before the Olympic games, and the Argives, Eleans and Mantineans will travel to Athens ten days before the Great Panathenaea. 
Thucydides states that the Corinthians did not join (literally ξυνώμοσαν) this offensive and defensive alliance, but were content with their first alliance with Argos (see oath id 1698) which was defensive only.

The date (and the very existence) of Lycurgus is open to debate. Herodotus names Lycurgus as the guardian of the Agiad king Leobotes (ca.900), but most later writers associate him with the Eurypontid king Charillos (ca.775). 
However, it seems most likely that the reforms to the Spartan constitution took place much later during the sixth century.

Darius had previously summoned Histiaeus to Susa. Histiaeus left Aristagoras to rule Miletus in his absence, but wished to return to Ionia.  
When Darius learned that Aristagoras had led the Ionians to revolt and had sacked Sardis, he complained to Histiaeus about the fact that the man he had placed in charge in Miletus was leading the revolt. 
Histiaeus asked to be sent to Ionia so that he might restore the country to peace and deliver Aristagoras into the hands of Darius. His oath followed this request. 
Herodotus goes on to say that Histiaeus was deceiving Darius. His oath only applied when (or if) he had settled the affairs of Ionia in the manner in which the king wished and handed Aristagoras over to Darius as a prisoner; he did not in fact do these things (and had not sworn to do them!), so his oath never became effective."

Aristotle tries to find valid arguments for refusing an opponent's oath-challenge (e.g. that the oath is only to be taken with a view to money), but in reality no one could do this convincingly, and litigants who have refused such a challenge normally avoid discussing the matter in their speeches. There follows advice regarding what to say when taking an oath or issuing an oath challenge. Taking an oath, one may claim confidence in oneself, but not in one's opponent, and one may argue that the only fair thing is for the impious man to tender the oath and the pious man to take it, and that it would be terrible to refuse an oath, while demanding that the judges take one before giving their verdict. This last point should also be mentioned on tendering oaths, along with a declaration of faith in the gods as judges. Aristotle also argues that if one has already taken an oath which contradicts the present one, it can be argued that the previous oath was taken by error or under compulsion; whereas if it is the opponent who has taken an oath which he now contradicts, it can be said that one who does not abide by what he swore subverts everything, for this is the reason the dikasts take an oath before applying the laws, and the opponent can be accused of demanding the judges' adherence to their oaths while himself not abiding by his."

It is perhaps worth mentioning the now widespread view (much stressed e.g. by Hornblower) that this alliance with Amorges was the decisive error that lost the Peloponnesian War; for a sceptical view (of this analysis, and of And.’s evidence) see H.D.

(Hornblower on Thuc. 1.112.2-4 dismisses Westlake too easily; certainly Thuc. 8.5.5 shows that in 413/2 ""the situation had [recently] changed in some respect"", but it is by no means ""obvious"" that the change had to do with Athenian support for Amorges – Westlake’s case, ignored here by Hornblower, was that what had changed things was the annihilation of the Athenian fleet in Sicily.)  We should mention ML 70, which seems to support And.'s statement about an agreement in 424/3 (not mentioned by Thucydides).

There is a general tendency in antiquity, to us surprising, to refer casually to different persons of the same name in close proximity and rely on the context to distinguish between them; this tendency is particularly noticeable in speeches in inheritance lawsuits (such as those of Isaeus), where translators are forced to insert Roman numerals in brackets to make it clear whether the speaker is talking about (say) Dicaeogenes I, II or III when the speaker himself just says Dicaeogenes, every time.  Cf. also, for example, Ar. Acharnians 46-51 where a character gives his name as Amphitheus, then says “Amphitheus was the son of Demeter and Triptolemus”, and then gives a genealogy which makes him the great-grandson of this earlier Amphitheus – a passage which can’t be translated without amplification, e.g. speaking of “the first Amphitheus” or “the original Amphitheus.”  In our passage it would be easy for a listener or reader to distinguish between the Cyrus of 4.16, who is described as having (actually) been an excellent king, and the Cyrus of 4.18 of whom it can only be said that he would have been one had he lived to reign."
