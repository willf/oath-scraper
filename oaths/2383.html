        <strong>This oath is an example of Andocides' customary historical inaccuracy. <br>Andocides states that when the Athenians were involved in the war in Euboea (446) and were holding Megara, Pegae and Troezen (Megara revolted in 446), the Athenians longed for peace and recalled Miltiades, the son of Cimon, who had been ostracised, and sent him to Sparta to negotiate a truce. As a result a fifty year peace treaty was concluded, and the Athenians abided by the truce for thirteen years. <br>This, however, was not the case. It was Cimon the son of Miltiades who was ostracised (461) and negotiated a truce with the Spartans (451/0).  <br>This truce actually lasted for five years.  <br>The Andocides manuscripts read that the truce was for "five" years, but editors emend the text of Andocides to match that of Aeschines 2.172 (see oath id 2631) which also states that Miltiades negotiated a truce with the Spartans which lasted for fifty years. <br>What was negotiated in 451/0 was a truce for five years.  But obviously Andocides must have written "fifty", since he says the truce held for 13 years.  The confusion is truly massive; in fact thirteen years was the duration of the war that was ended by the Thirty Years’ Peace referred to in section 6 of the speech!  In other words:  a five years’ truce that suspended (but did not end) a war whose total duration was thirteen years has become a fifty years’ truce, ending a war of unspecified duration, which held for thirteen years and was followed by a renewed war of unspecified duration. Another possible explanation is that Andocides, without knowing it, is reporting the peace treaty of 446 (see oath id 2384) twice over, and that the thirteen years are meant to run from that date until 433 when Athens incurred the hostility of Corinth by intervening in its conflict with Corcyra. <br>Andocides states that the Athenians gained the following benefits from the supposed fifty years' peace: <br>1. they fortified the Piraeus [actually done much earlier]; <br>2. they built the northern Long Wall [actually done in 457, during a period of active warfare!]; <br>3. they built one hundred triremes to replace the old ones that had defeated Xerxes [as if no new ships had been built since 480]; <br>4. they established a force of three hundred horsemen; <br>5. they purchased the three hundred Scythian archers. <br>See also oath id 1542.</strong>
