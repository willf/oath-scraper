        <strong>One unnamed citizen is found to have broken the terms of the amnesty and was executed as an example to all at the suggestion of Archinus, after which no one broke the terms of the agreement (see oath id 1799). The terms of the reconciliation are as follows (quoting Rhodes' translation of 39): "Of the Athenians who had remained in the city, those who wished to emigrate might occupy Eleusis, retain their rights as citizens, with full power and authority over themselves, and continue to draw the revenues from their own property. The sanctuary at Eleusis was to be common to both communities, under the care of the Heralds and Eumolpidae in accordance with tradition. No one from Eleusis was to go to the city, and no one from the city was to go to Eleusis, except in each case for the Mysteries. Those at Eleusis were to contribute to the alliance from their revenues in the same way as the rest of the Athenians [see oath id 1786]. If anyone who emigrated took a house at Eleusis, he was to seek agreement with the owner; if they were unable to agree, each should choose three assessors, and the owner should accept whatever price they fixed. Any of the people of Eleusis might join the community if they were approved by the new settlers. Those who wished to emigrate to Eleusis should be entitled to register, in the case of those already in the city of Athens, within ten days of swearing the oaths of reconciliation, and to emigrate within twenty days; in the case of those who were away from Athens, within the same period from their return. No one living at Eleusis should be entitled to hold office in the city, without cancelling his registration and returning to live in the city. Trials for homicide should be held in accordance with tradition in cases where a man had himself performed the act of killing or wounding. Otherwise no one was to recall the past misdeeds of the anyone except the Thirty, the Ten, the Eleven and the governors of the Piraeus, and not even of these if they successfully submitted to an examination. The examination was to take place, for the governors of the Piraeus, among the men of the Piraeus; for those who had held office in the city, among those possessed of a property qualification. Alternatively, those who were not willing to submit to an examination might emigrate. Each side was to repay separately the money that it had borrowed for the war".
